## Web Technologies Used

Using the browser inspection tools (Inspect → Elements, Sources, and Network tabs), I observed that the Internet Archive website uses:

- **HTML** to structure the pages (visible in the Elements tab).
- **CSS** files to control layout, fonts, and styling.
- **JavaScript** files to handle interactivity, navigation, and search features.

I also observed other file types that I did not initially recognize, including:

- Image files such as `.jpg` and `.png`
- Data requests that appear to load content dynamically

These technologies work together to present and organize digitized cultural objects such as games and software.

## Who Built the Website

The website is built and maintained by the **Internet Archive**, a nonprofit digital library founded by Brewster Kahle.

Evidence:
- The Internet Archive About page explains the organization and its mission:  
  https://archive.org/about/
- The organization maintains public code repositories on GitHub:  
  https://github.com/internetarchive

From this information, it is clear that the website is maintained by a team of developers, archivists, and contributors rather than a single individual.

## GitHub Repository

Internet Archive GitHub organization:  
https://github.com/internetarchive

I was able to find this by searching for "Internet Archive GitHub" and confirming that it is linked to the same organization.

## Assessment

The Internet Archive demonstrates how digital libraries rely on web technologies to provide access to cultural materials. HTML structures the information, CSS controls visual presentation, and JavaScript allows users to search, browse, and interact with collections. The use of additional files such as fonts and images supports accessibility and presentation.
